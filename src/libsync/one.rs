//! A "once initialization" primitive

/// A type which can be used to run a one-time global initialization.
///
/// This type can only be statically constructed with the `ONCE_INIT` value.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use sync::one::{Once, ONCE_INIT};
///
/// static mut START: Once = ONCE_INIT;
/// unsafe {
///     START.doit(|| {
///         // run initialization here
///     });
/// }
/// ```

    /// will be executed if this is the first time `doit` has been called, and
    /// otherwise the routine will *not* be invoked.
    ///
    /// This method will block the calling task if another initialization
    /// routine is currently running.
    ///
    /// When this function returns, it is guaranteed that some initialization
    /// has run and completed (it may not be the closure specified).

        // the work, then we use a second value to keep track of how many outstanding
        // threads are trying to use the mutex. When the last thread releases the
        // mutex it drops the lock count to a "very negative" value to indicate to
        // other threads that the mutex is gone.
